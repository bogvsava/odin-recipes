    <h2>How to make pork-fried-rice</h2>
    <p>This pork fried rice recipe is my revised version of another recipe. I often substitute chicken for pork, and it doesnt change anything. I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish only a slight flavor difference. I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes </p>
     <p>Ingredients</p>
     <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li> 
        <li>1 (6 ounce) boneless pork loin chop, cut into small pieces</li>

        <li>¼ cup chopped carrot</li>
